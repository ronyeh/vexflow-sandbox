# VexFlow Sandbox

The VexFlow 5 sandbox is hosted on GitHub Pages:

https://vexflow.github.io/vexflow-sandbox/

The site is built with the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

1. Use pnpm (or npm) to install dependencies.
    ```

    ```
1. The `src/` folder contains `index.html`, which is interpreted as a [liquid template](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/liquid/).
